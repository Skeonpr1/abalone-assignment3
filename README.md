# Data Directory

This folder is intentionally **empty** in the public repository to avoid sharing large or private files.

## Expected files (place locally here)
- `train.csv`
- `test.csv`
- `sample_submission.csv`

## How to obtain
Download the competition data from Kaggle and place the three CSVs in this `data/` folder.

## Notes
- The notebook expects `data/train.csv`, `data/test.csv`, and `data/sample_submission.csv`.
- Do **not** commit these files to Git. The root `.gitignore` excludes everything under `data/` except this README.
